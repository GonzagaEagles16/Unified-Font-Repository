It also aims for the promotion of open source typography by introducing a transversal and flexible classification. Technically, UFR is a folder architecture to organize font sources, inspirations and references. It is also a YAML file with useful meta informations about the typeface and its repository.\r\n\r\nMETADATA.yml contains the data useful to build a large independant database of typefaces. With this kind of identity informations, it can be easy to search and browse fonts by license, similar fonts, authors, keywordsâ€¦ METADATA.yml also reflects the folder structure and can link to the font files, github repository etc.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### METADATA.yml\r\n\r\n#### Tags\r\n\r\nAs a font designer you are free to chose the tags you find relevant for your font but we encourage the use of the following tags, in order of importance:\r\n\r\n- Type: serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy, monospace, handwriting\r\n- Feelings: contrasted, smooth, light, weird\r\n- Time and location: 80s, China, Africa ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
